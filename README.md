## Running the tests

I have created a couple of test cases to make sure my application will be working as expected when it goes to production. Therefore, you can run those tests just typing the command below:

In my tests, I used karma + jasmine and you are able to follow the test running through the report which is created always when test runner get started. Check this out in the _coverage_ folder.
